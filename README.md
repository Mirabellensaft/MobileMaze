# MobileMaze
üï≥Ô∏è this was a maze game, playable in mobile browsers, by tilting your phone.

The tilting does not work anymore, as accelerometer access in mobile browsers is prohibited now, as this poses a security risk. 

What this game was about:

By tilting your phone, you were able to guide the black ball through the maze into the goal area that is marked by a black ring. Upon reaching the goal,
a new maze was generated. 

You can simulate this today by guiding the ball by touch or grabbing it with the mouse.
